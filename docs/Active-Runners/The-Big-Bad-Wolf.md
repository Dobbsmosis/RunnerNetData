| ----------- | ----------- |
| The Mummified Finger | One of three technomancers hired for the job, which required the team to steal a relic on display in St. James' Cathedral, ideally without anyone knowing that it had been stolen.<br />The Big Bad Wolf himself disabled sensors that would have detected the weapons and smoke grenades being smuggled into the cathedral. He also locked certain external doors to influence the panicked congregation to flee in a certain direction and delay the arrival of unwanted reinforcements. |
