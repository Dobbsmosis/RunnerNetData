> "Big trouble is brewing, and we've got gangers getting jumpy. Not a great combination. I need some people to get me out of my current spot and out to safety. I don't want to be around when all this finally boils over. The sooner the better, but I think I've got a couple days at the very latest before its to late. I've got 5K per for the group. We can talk bonuses when we come to that. Serious replies only. PS Bring a gun." The poster leaves the initials "AK" along with a commcode, and address.
